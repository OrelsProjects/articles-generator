Should we serve kids healthier food, especially in schools? Yes!

But my school served us all ultra-processed sludge‚Äîpizza, chicken nuggets, fries, chocolate milk‚Äîand perhaps 3% of kids were obese. 

Now the childhood obesity rate is 20%.

What changed?

Recess and play.

We got an hour of recess that we‚Äôd spend running our asses off playing tag.

After school, we‚Äôd go outside and play games and sports. 

I think removing activity from kids‚Äô days is a far more important factor in health and weight status. 

Make recess and unsupervised play great again."
