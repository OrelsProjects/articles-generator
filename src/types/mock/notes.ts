  /**cm7qxqzvf8dxpnunc6wothxgf	80473909	comment	11600151	"Here’s what I have trouble squaring about the kids and ultraprocessed food debate.

Should we serve kids healthier food, especially in schools? Yes!

But my school served us all ultra-processed sludge—pizza, chicken nuggets, fries, chocolate milk—and perhaps 3% of kids were obese. 

Now the childhood obesity rate is 20%.

What changed?

Recess and play.

We got an hour of recess that we’d spend running our asses off playing tag.

After school, we’d go outside and play games and sports. 

I think removing activity from kids’ days is a far more important factor in health and weight status. 

Make recess and unsupervised play great again."
