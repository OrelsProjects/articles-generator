Consistency matters more than perfection (nobody remembers your last 'meh' post, but they notice when you disappear)\n\n2. Being helpful beats being clever (solve real problems, skip the witty wordplay)\n\n3. The real growth doesn't come from viral posts—it comes from showing up when everyone else quits\n\nThe path is simple but not easy: write daily, help constantly, quit never.",

Write your previous article ideas as context for the Chat and ask for new ideas. You’ll get tons of inspiration.\n\nCreate a new project, call it writing and every time you have a new idea, ask the chat to generate tags for it and remember it. You can then pull out ideas about any topic at any moment.\n\nThis one can be solved even without AI. Use the Flesch-Kincaid algorithm to determine how readable your text is. If it’s not good enough, you can ask the Chat to improve it to get a high FK score.\n\nUsing AI is not “killing your voice” if you use it correctly.",

Explain exactly what the product does\n\n2. Add an input + button for users to insert their email if their interested\n\n3. Publish this landing page to your social media followers\n\nThat way you can get a pretty good idea to how many people will actually find it useful and decide whether you should spend the weeks to build or not.\n\nKeep in mind:\n\nSpending days and weeks building a product (guilty as sin 🙈), just to find out nobody cares about it, will kill your motivation.",

It's been a year since I started my solopreneurship journey.\n\nAnd I have nothing to show for.\n\n0$ in income. Scratching the 2k mark followers on LinkedIn and I am running out of ideas and motivation to do anything.\n\nIt's in this moment that the time for a 30 days vacation I planned with my girlfriend has come.\n\nAnd the guilt and stress levels rise fast.\n\nThere's no way back from it, everything was already planned and purchased. No refunds.\n\nFast forward 28 days. I am walking the markets of Korea, the skies are gray and it's raining. It's almost time to go back home, and I am anxious.\n\nAs I walk around with my girlfriend and look around into a stores of random keychains and dolls, between dozens of Koreans around me, a sentence on the wall catches my attention:\n\n\"Make this year different than the last one\".\n\nWow. It was in front of my eyes all this time.\n\nAfter a year of being stuck in the same room, feeling like everyday is just like the other one, I realized that I was doing it all wrong.\n\nI was trying to do many things all at once, thinking I was doing good because I tried different systems to manage this mess until I found what works for me.\n\nBut the problem was not the systems. It was lack of focus.\n\nI decided that every month I will focus on 3 things, set goals for each of them, plan how to achieve them and measure progress every week.\n\nSo for this month, I focus on:\n\n→ Storytelling\n\n→ Building products\n\n→ Focus and discipline\n\nI planned the week ahead for those targets, each in a specific way.\n\nBy the end of the week I will measure the progress I made and optimize for next week.\n\nSo remember, even if your anxious of filled with guilt about a vacation you're going to take, it can turn out to be one of the best things you'll do.",

It worked!\n\nEver since I decided to go out of the house every day I feel much more balanced.\n\nAlthough I am not at the peak, I feel like there's something that stops me from tipping off to the depression side.\n\nIf you're starting out, please, don't do that to yourself.\n\nGo out, break a sweat and prepare your mind and body for the long run.\n\nI wrote about 11 more mistakes I made in this article:\n\nhttps://theindiepreneur.substack.com/p/11-mistakes-i-made-as-a-solopreneur\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nI am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.\n\nJoin me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

      body: "Well, this is awkward. The project I was so excited about... Is already dead. \n\nLet me explain.\n\nI thought about the idea of improving property owner's images a few months ago when I was looking for hotels in Asia. By then Adobe had a plan for the Photoshop API, which was 0.15$ per successful request.\n\nExpensive, but doable.\n\nYesterday I decided to cancel my rest day after finishing a book I was reading. I started building a plan to finish an MVP in a week. One of the things I needed to do was to have plans.\n\nSo, I tried to find out if there's a cheaper plan for Photoshop API. I found something much worse.\n\nApparently, since April Adobe removed their Photoshop API pricing page. And since June they no longer offered any plans to extend the quota beyond the free one, which is 500 requests, unless you're an enterprise.\n\nI tried to find any explanation for it for over 5 hours and couldn't find anything but complaints about Adobe's service.\n\nLesson for next time? Hard to tell. I had checked everything when I had the idea, so I assumed nothing would change.\n\nIt took me a few hours and a few slices of pizza 🍕 to get over the bad feelings, but now I am ready for the next project, which is already in motion!\n\nMore about it soon! :)",

It uses AI to determine the type and atmosphere of the image and runs it through a Photoshop pipeline that improves the image.\n\nAnd the results?

Save the previous state.\n\n2. Run the request (Without awaiting a response) \n\n3. Update the UI as if the request was successful\n\nNow, was did the request return a success status?\n\nYes → Update crucial information, like ids.\n\nNo → Restore the previous state and let the user know.\n\nThe bad experience 0.1% of your users will experience does not worth letting the other 99.9% wait.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nI am a solopreneur who quit his 6 figures job to chase his dream and be independent.\n\nJoin me as I figure out more about this world and share the lessons from it.",

It doesn't matter.\n\nBecause there's a better question to ask:\n\n'Why do I post it?':\n\nShow others who feel the same that they are not alone\n\nShare the journey of being an indiepreneur\n\nKeep up with my consistent posting\n\nValidate my feelings\n\nHelp others\n\nMake sure your why's good enough.\n\nPeople will care regardless of how you feel.\n\nAnd if they don’t?

And I don't particularly enjoy it.\n\nI had my ups and a fair share of downs in the last 7 months,\n\nand it is not easy at all.\n\nBut it's okay because enjoying the journey doesn't mean you need to have fun.\n\nIt means that whatever path you take,\n\nmake sure you make the best of it.\n\nYou might hate what you do in the beginning, yet push through.\n\nThat doesn't mean you don't enjoy the journey.\n\nYou grow and you build the life that you want to have.\n\nAnd most of the time, having the life that you want requires sacrifices and hardships you'll have to endure.\n\nIt's either you choose your hardships in life,\n\nor life chooses them for you.\n\nAnd the latter option usually comes at an unexpected time,\n\nwith many subsequent ones.\n\nSo for me, enjoying the journey means that if I stop and look back, I am happy that I have chosen the path I did.\n\nQ: How do you enjoy your journey?\n\nQ2: What does \"Enjoy the journey\" mean to you?\n\nThanks, @Melissa Kwan for the inspiration to write the post!",

      body: "AI is taking our jobs as software engineers\n\nYesterday, Cognition AI, a startup backed by Peter Thiel, announced the first AI software engineer, called Devin.\n\nDevin is an autonomous agent that solves engineering tasks through the use of its own shell, code editor, and web browser.\n\nPeople are afraid to lose their engineering jobs to AI. And for no reason.\n\nLet me go over some of the remarks made in yesterday's Twitter post.\n\n\"..and has even completed real jobs on Upwork.\"\n\nWhich jobs? there are so many jobs on Upwork that literally require a prompt in chatGPT.\n\n“…When evaluated on the SWE-Bench benchmark, which asks an AI to resolve GitHub issues found in real-world open-source projects, Devin correctly resolves 13.86% of the issues unassisted...\"\n\nThis might sound impressive at first. Take a moment to think how many random, basic or repeated questions there are.\n\nLook, all in all, it's cool. It does a lot of things automatically, through it's own environment and tools.\n\nBut as a software engineer, the thing that I hate the most is waiting. Even a minute. It kills my flow and makes me way less productive.\n\nImagine how many developers will open their phones while they wait for a prompt from Devin.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong. I love using AI to help me write code faster and I embrace those changes.\n\nI use Copilot and ChatGPT consistently to remove repetitive tasks.\n\nAnd I really think you should do so too.But it's not there yet. \n\nI believe there's a huge leap that needs to be made before we can consider a scenario where software engineers are a thing of the past.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about AI and our future as software engineers?",
